# Projectile Motion Simulation With StdDraw
This Java program simulates projectile motion based on user-provided angle values. The main objective is to calculate and visualize the trajectory of a projectile launched at a given angle. The program employs basic physics formulas and utilizes the StdDraw library for graphical representation.

## Instructions
Compile and run the Java program.
Input the launch angle in degrees when prompted.
The program will simulate the projectile motion and display the trajectory on a graphical canvas.
The final output includes the entered angle and the calculated maximum distance of the projectile.

## Program Details
The program uses a class and includes a main method for execution.
The user is prompted to input an angle value in degrees.
The program checks if the entered angle is valid for projectile motion (less than or equal to 180 degrees).
It then calculates the total time of flight, maximum distance, and simulates the projectile motion in a graphical representation.
The simulation uses predefined constants such as velocity, gravity, and time increment.
The StdDraw library is utilized to draw the trajectory on a canvas.

## Dependencies
Java Standard Library
StdDraw Library

## How to Run
Ensure Java is installed on your system.
Compile the program using a Java compiler.
Run the compiled program.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the launch angle.

## Notes
The program accounts for angles greater than 90 degrees by mirroring the graph for proper functionality.
The simulation is displayed in real-time using the StdDraw library.

## Sample Output
The program outputs the entered angle and the calculated maximum distance in kilometers.
Feel free to modify and expand upon this template based on your specific requirements and additional details about the program.
